### Pizzeria 
## About the project
In the pizzeria on Partynicka Street there are several chefs and Mr. Piotr and Mr. Pawe≈Ç - suppliers. Preparing a pizza consists of the following steps

<ul>
<li> Washing hands
<li> Activities at the counter: rolling out the dough, applying the sauce and ingredients
<li> Putting in (and taking out) the pizza from the oven (you don't have to constantly stand by the oven, if you put the pizzas there, you can do something else)
<li> Packed in a box and placed on a shelf for suppliers
</ul>
  
# Limitations:
Unfortunately, there is only 1 washbasin and a stove in the restaurant, and the size of the vegetable / cheese / sauce, etc. stand is such that only one person is comfortable working there. The oven can bake 4 pizzas at a time and the oven periodically increases the baking of pizzas currently in it. The shelf can hold a maximum of 20 boxes, otherwise the pyramid gets too high and starts falling. Suppliers can hold a maximum of 8 boxes in a thermal food bag and they do not move until it is full, so as not to go with 1 pizza.

# Threads: cooks, vendors, oven
# Resources: sink, table, stove, shelf, thermal bag
# Critical sections: washing hands, preparing pizza, putting it in the oven, stacking it on the shelf, packing it in a backpack

# Possible dangers:
No pizza will be made, the chefs will never wash their hands, the pizzas on the shelf will tip over, there will never be enough pizzas for a supplier to move, one supplier will still sit around doing nothing.
